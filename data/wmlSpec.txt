# Blank lines are ignored. Whitespace can be any number of of spaces and/or tabs
# All record types are optional unless otherwise stated
# parens indicate an optional value
# value types are: text, int, float, note, octNote. "note" is a standard note name, e.g. "Bb", 
#    octNote adds an octave number, e.g "C4"
# value options are in square brackets, e.g. [mm|inch]
# Although characters '()[]|" are used here to indicate grammar, they do NOT appear in an actual file
# Similarly, if "(name:text)" (e.g.) appears below, the only thing that appears in the file is a string, e.g. 'Fred'

# These are for identifying information (e.g. that might appear in an index):

id text 			# A unique identifier
name text		# A short label (e.g. that might be used in a graph legend)
type [flute|whistle|bagpipe|...]	# The general type of instrument
subType [classical|modern|uillean|quena|...]	# More specific information about the type of instrument
owner text 		# The current owner of the instrument (a person or institution)
maker text		# The maker of the instrument (a person or company)
serial text 		# The serial number of the instrument
createdBy text	# The person who created this file
measuredBy text   # The person who made the measurement
url text			# A link to associated information
version float	# a version number
comments text	# Brief additional comments (e.g. date of manufacture)

# Technical info 
units [mm|inch]
keyOf note	# nominal scale, e.g. C for a boehm flute, Bb for a band flute, F for a small whistle...
noteRange lowNote:octNote highNote:octNote	# The instrument's range, e.g. "C4 C6". 
pitchStandard float	# The frequency of A in the pitch the instrument is built for (e.g. 440.)

# Measurements
# secX indicates a section coordinate measured from the top (blowing end) of the current section.
part name:text	# Start new part. Only needed for instruments like bagpipes that have chanter, drones, etc.
section name:text length:float	# Start new section. At least one section is required.
altSection name:text	# Like section, but indicates it can substitute for the current section  
#  (e.g. corps de rechange in historical flutes)
toneHoles # start a list of tone holes in this section
secX:double holeDiam:double (holeAngle:double) (bodyDiam:double) (bodyToTop:double) # A tone hole measurement
#  angle is clockwise when looking down the instrument (i.e. from top to bottom)
blowHole secX:double length:double width:double	(bodyDiam:double) (corkDist:double) # Embouchure or fipple hole 
# in the current section. "length" is along instrument, "width" is crosswise.
joint tenonDir:[up|down] tenonDiam:float tenonLength:float (extension:float)	# A tenon/socket joint; this record 
# must appear between any two sections (and can optionally appear before the first section)
bore					# Start a section bore profile
body    				# Start a section body profile
secX:float diam:float	# a measurement in a body or bore profile
